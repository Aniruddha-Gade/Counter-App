I've built a simple counter app that allows you to increment and decrement a counter using buttons. It's a great way to practice React and get familiar with state management!

Features:
        Plus Button: Increases the counter by 1.
        Minus Button: Decreases the counter by 1.

        Reset Button: counter sets to 0

        Before Button: Decreases the counter by 10.
        After Button: Increases the counter by 10.
